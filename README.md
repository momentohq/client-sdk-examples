# Momento Client Libraries

Hi, welcome to the example repository for [Momento](https://gomomento.com)! Here you will find examples and use cases for implementing Momento Cache and Topics in your application. 

If you aren't familiar with Momento, check out our [getting started guide](https://docs.momentohq.com/docs/getting-started) and visit the [Momento Console](https://console.gomomento.com) to get started in minutes. Momento handles all of the operational concerns (performance, scaling, replication, etc.) with caching and event messaging for you so you can just focus on the things that actually matter!

To interact with Momento from your favorite programming language, check out our official client libraries:

* [Golang](https://github.com/momentohq/client-sdk-go)
* [Java](https://github.com/momentohq/client-sdk-java)
* [.NET](https://github.com/momentohq/client-sdk-dotnet)
* [Node.js](https://github.com/momentohq/client-sdk-nodejs)
